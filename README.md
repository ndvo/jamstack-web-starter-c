# Overview

This project offers you a ready made JAM Stack website with
a hosted e-commerce solution. You'll see it in action right
away and will be able to customize everything to fit your
needs.

- **[JAM Stack?](https://jamstack.org/)** a serverless architecture providing pre-rendered websites.
- **[Hosted e-commerce
  solution?](https://wiki.foxycart.com/v/2.0/foxycarts_reason_for_being)** an e-commerce solution
  professionally managed. All security and compliance
  concearns are taken care of. You can focus on building
  your content.
- **[Continuous
  deployment?](https://www.netlify.com/products/workflow/)**
  your code will be easily and continuously delivered to
  production.

**[Convinced yet? Let's do it!](#lets-do-it)** Not quite? Go
on.

## Why?

In short: **because you'll have a lightning fast, safe and
unexpensive e-commerce website!**

Here's a longer version:

- **performance:** a JAM Stack makes your website  very
  fast. It's no miracle. Every page is pre-built during
  compilation, therefore not only there is no processing to
  be done when your client visit your store, but also the
  website can be distributed among may different servers
  across the globle with a service called Content Delivery
  Network (CDN). This means that your client will access the
  fastest possible server anywhere it is.
- **security:** the JAM Stack architecture means the server
  does not run anything. Therefore, it won't run anything
  provided by a malicious user. It is also not connected to
  any database, so you'll have no issues there either. The
  shopping cart and payment processing are done by a [PCI
  Compliant Level 1 Service
  Provider](https://wiki.foxycart.com/static/foxycart_security).
- **infraestructure costs:** the serverless architecture of
  JAM Stack requires only the CDN servers, which would
  probably be necessary anyway. 
- **ease of development** there are few requirements for the
  development environment. Testing can be done without much
  effort, including manual and acceptance tests.

## Who?

This is an Open Source project (as you can see), built on
top of [awesome projects](#acknowledgements) and sponsored
by Foxy.io.

The project was conceived after the guys at Foxy realized it
could help many small businesses and non-profit
organizations quickly go online after being severely hit by
the COVID-19 pandemic.

## How to use this project?

That's easy!

1. Fork it or Deploy it on Netlify
1. Customize it by adding your brand and products

Upon clicking the deploy to Netlify button you'll have a
website up and running, a forked repository to work with and
you'll be able to start customizing right away.

We're adding relevant comments to the code so that you
understand clearly where and how you can change it to
achieve what you need.  We're commenting each file and
adding a README to each folder. We surely cannot include
everything there is to know, but you'll find some helpful
references.

### How?



# Let's do it

There are two ways for you to start your own JAM Stack e-commerce using this
repository. You may fork it and customize it, or you may start your own from
scratch following the tutorial bellow.

## Let's fork it!
If you want to fork it, go ahead! Every file is documented so that you will know
what to tweak and how.

Simply click the fork me button and you will have your own version of the
repository.

## Let's deploy it!!

**What?** That's it! You can now deploy your own version of the site so that
you can already see it in production.

<a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/ndvo/jamstack-web-starter"><img src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy to Netlify"></a>

**Is that it?** Pretty much. You do need to configure your own Foxy.io account
and set the name, logo and products of your store, but it is basically done. But
what's the fun on that? I'm sure you need to create your own features and make
your store unique.

## Let's hack it!!!

It's time to get our hands dirty to have our e-Commerce ready to sell!

#### In short:

1. **Set your own products:** there's a `_products` folder. Replace the products with
   your own. If you need to fetch your products from an API
   or from a file, check the [data section](#data).
1. **Set your own logo:** replace the
   `src/static/img/mylogo.png` file with your own. Also,
   replace the *favicon* files in `src/static/img/`.
1. **Set your own theme:** if your are comfortable with CSS and
   TailWindCSS, go for it. If you aren't, check out the
   `tailwind.config.js` file in the root directory of the
   project. By setting these variables you can start making
   the website look your own.
1. **Set your own videos:** there's a `src/_highlights` folder. In this
   Each file contains something you want to highlight. Add
   or remove de `.md` files do add or remove highlights. The
   first one will be the first video available. They are
   also used to build the Highlight section of the website.
1. **Set your own texts:** there's a
   `src/_data/site.yaml` file. You'll find you can customize
   most of the site's texts there. You can set the
   navigation links, the highlight texts and display
   messages to your users.
 1. **Fetch your data on compile time:** there's a
    `src/_data/lorem.js` file. It demonstrates how to fetch
    data from your own API during compile time. This way you
    can have your content updated on each new deploy.
   

## Want to dive deeper? 

Here are some concepts that will help you go further

- **11ty's data:** your [data can be stored however you
  want](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data/).  It may be
  [computed data](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-computed/),
  that is, data you fetch from a database or API from a
  server you already have or, if you're starting from
  scratch, let me suggest you to create simple text files in
  [YAML format](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#Preview)
  in the `_data` directory. You'll be amazed of the
  simplicity of this approach. For complex needs you can use
  Javascript files and use the default export to provide the
  data. With this approach you can preprocess the data
  anyway you want. The [`src/_data/lorem.js` file
  demonstrate quite simply how to fetch data from an
  API](blob/master/src/_data/lorem.js).
- **11ty's templates:** your template files [can most
  probably be written in the a templating language you are
  already familiar
  with](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/). If you don't
  know any of these, don't worry, you can customize the
  templates provided in this project and you'll learn the
  templating language we're using as you go.  We're using
  mostly [Nunjucks templating
  language](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html)
  and
  [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
  in this project. Nunjucks is a powerfull language and will most
  probably meet your needs, while Markdown is as simple as
  it can get and you feel quite comfortable with it in
  minutes.
- **TailwindCSS:** creating a responsive and visually
  attractive website can be quite a hard task. There are
  plenty of tools out there. For this project we chose
  Tailwind. It focuses on allowing custom designs. Of course
  there are a lot of ready made designs out there you can
  simply use, but the fact is that sooner or later you'll
  want to tweek it and build your own custom design.
  Tailwind is highly customizable and avoids imposing
  anything on you. Simply go to
  [tailwindcss.com](https://tailwindcss.com/) and use their
  search bar to find a class that meets your needs. You'll
  also be interested in configuring TailwindCSS using the
  [`tailwind.config.js` file](tailwind.config.js).
- **e-commerce:** Foxy.io's hosted
  [cart](https://docs.foxycart.com/v/2.0/cart) solution fits
  perfectly with the serverless architecture. It does not
  require you to use any particular CMS or CRM and does not
  require you to provide your products and prices in
  advance.  It provides the payment and shopping cart
  solution and allows you to [customize it's look and
  feel](https://docs.foxycart.com/v/2.0/templates), 

# Example

Here's a plan: let's first add our own products. In doing so we will be able to
understand how we'll the store will fit our needs. Next we'll tweek it's look and
feel. Finally, we'll add some extra niceties for our store.

### Where do my products go?

You can do this in several ways. We'll explore two of them: creating your
products as Markdown files and consuming your products from an external API.

#### Customizing collections

You can learn a great deal about Eleventy's collections
https://www.11ty.dev/docs/collections/.

Here's what you need to get started:

1. Create a "products" collection by creating a `_products` folder in the `src`
   folder. If you wish to create new collections, simply create folders with
   different names, starting with `_` as in `_name`.
1. Customize your collection using the `_products.json` file in the `_products`
   folder.
   1. Set a "category" for all products in this folder. This well allow you to create pages that list all products in a category.
   1. Set the permalink for the items in the category. This will allow you to have a different page for each product.

##### Example: Allow the user to filter by category

Here are the changes we need to make to allow the user to
filter our products by category with a simple select button.

We will filter only the products available on the page and
learn how to use data from our collection items in the
process.

###### Add an attribute to the data
Let's go to the [`src/_products`](tree/master/src/_products)
folder and edit some of these products.

Let's add a new attribute called 'productType' and set it to
'cool':

```
productType: cool
```

Select some other products and add a different productType, perhaps
the tag 'hot':

```
productType: hot
```

###### Use the data in the HTML

Now lets create the select element. Navigate to the
[`src/index.js` file](blob/master/src/index.njk) and look
for a line where it reads:

` {% for product in collections.product | sortByPriceHighToLow %}`

Before the `section` tag above that line we'll add a simple select element:

```
<select data-action="hideProductType">
  <option value="all">All</option>
  <option value="hot">Hot</option>
  <option value="cool">Cool</option>
</select>
```

We will use this select to choose between *cool* and *hot*
products.

Next, let's add a class to our products so that we can
distinguish the cool ones from the hot ones. Let's add a
'product' class to the beginning of our product class list
and we will access the productType data to add the
productType to the end of the classList.

```
<section class="container p-2 pb-4 m-auto flex w-full flex-wrap items-stretch justify-start relative">
  {% for product in collections.product | sortByPriceHighToLow %}
  <div class="product flex flex-col items-center w-full
  lg:w-1/2 p-2 {{ product.data.productType}}">
    {# TIP: Use includes to avoid repetition
```

###### Add the behaviour in the js file

Finally, let's go to the `src/_assets/scripts/app.js` file
and add some behaviour to our select button.

First, let's add a function that will filter the results.
This is certainly not the most performant function, but you
can easily get what it does:

```
// Filter selection button
function hideProductType(e) {
  var toShow = e.target.value;
  if (toShow == 'all') {
    document.querySelectorAll('div.product')
      .forEach(product => product.classList.remove('hidden'));
  } else {
    document.querySelectorAll('div.product')
      .forEach(product => product.classList.add('hidden'));
    document.querySelectorAll('div.product.'+toShow)
      .forEach(product => product.classList.remove('hidden'));
  }
}
```

It simply adds a 'hidden' class to all products and then
removes from those we want to display.

Now let's add this behaviour to the select button:

```
document.querySelector('select[data-action="hideProductType"]')
  .addEventListener("change", hideProductType);
```

This code should go the other `addEventListener` in this
file.

There you go! Our select filter is ready. Not nice, but
ready.


#### Customize the look and feel

Let's make it nice, shall we?

This won't be difficult. First, let's replace the content of
the default selection to "Filter the results"

```
  <option value="all">Filter the results</option>
```

Now it's easier to understand. Next, thanks to Tailwind
we'll simply add some classes to our select element.

```
<select class="m-4 p-1 text-darker border-2 border-light rounded" data-action="hideProductType">
```

That's it!

We made our select have rounded borders with a configurable
colors from our `tailwind.config.js` file. Did you notice
that we set border color to 'light'? There is no such color
by default, but it is configured in our tailwind.config.js
file.

Now, if someone wishes to change the theme, a quick tweak to
the config file will do.

# Where to go from here?
